# Patchbook extension for Visual Studio Code
This extension for Visual Studio Code adds syntax highlighting support for the [Patchbook markup language](https://github.com/SpektroAudio/Patchbook). Patchbook is a really useful markup language for documenting patches in modular synthesizers. For really complex patches, things can get hard to figure out, so this extension intends to help with that.

## File types
The extension adds syntax highlighting to two file types, `.patch` and `.patchml`.

## Building/testing the extension
Open the folder in Visual Studio Code and hit F5. Two test files are included.

## Installing the extension
Download the .ZIP file and place the *patch* folder in your VS Code extensions folder:

- Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\.vscode\extensions`
- macOS/Linux: `$HOME/.vscode/extensions`

If you clone the repo, copy the contents of the *patch* folder to appropriate folder under **extensions**.

## Customizing the extension
[Customizing](patch/) the extension to add better matches and color choices is easy and welcomed. :rocket:
