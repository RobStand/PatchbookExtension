# Patchbook extension for Visual Studio Code
This extension for Visual Studio Code adds syntax highlighting support for the [Patchbook markup language](https://github.com/SpektroAudio/Patchbook). Patchbook is a really useful markup language for documenting patches in modular synthesizers. For really complex patches, things can get hard to figure out, so this extension intends to help with that.
