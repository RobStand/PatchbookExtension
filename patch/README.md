## Voices

**Voices** must be written in all caps, without any spaces before the name and followed by a colon.  
Examples:

- BASS 1:
- VOICE 1:
- LEAD:

Every connection described after a voice annotation will be assigned to that voice.

---

## Connections

Every connection (patch cable) must be annotated using the following format: **- Output Module (Output Label) >> Input Module (Input Label)**.  
Examples:  

```
- Maths (Ch. 1 Unity) >> Polaris (CV 2)
- Tides (Bi) >> Braids (Timbre)
```

While the >> indicator can be used to indicate a standard connection, it could (and should) also be replaced by more specific indicators according to the kind of signal being sent from the Output Module to the Input Module:  

- >> for CV
- -> for Audio
- p> for Pitch (1v/oct or Hz/V)
- g> for Gate
- t> for Trigger
- c> for Clock

Examples:

```
- Metropolis (Pitch) p> Braids (1 V/Oct)
- Pamela's Workout (1) c> Penta (Clk)
- Braids (Out) -> Polaris (Input)
```

**Additional info:**

- The manufacturer's name should only be included if the module's name is too generic (example: VB Modular ADSR).
- Non-modular equipment (such as audio interfaces, recorders, and other synths) should be written in all caps: NAME OF GEAR (Input or Output).
- While specific module names are preferable, they can also be replaced by more generic names such as VCA, ADSR, Oscillator, etc.

**Extra arguments:**

Additional GraphViz arguments such as color, weight, and style can be appended to the connection line in between brackets and separated by commas. 

Example:
```
- Metropolis (Pitch) p> Braids (1 V/Oct) [color=red, weight=3]
```

Supported GraphViz arguments: color, weight, style, dir, and arrowtail.

## Parameters

Parameters can be annotated in 2 different ways: single line or multiline. Every parameter annotation must start with an asterisk character before the module name.

**Single-line**  
```
* Function: Rise = 50% | Fall = 50% | Curve = 30%
```

**Multi-Line**
```
* Braids:  
	| Mode = CSAW  
	| Color = 50%  
	| Timbre = 50%  
```

**Additional info**

- Parameter values can be written as knob / fader position (percentage), specific value followed by unit (5Hz, 10ms, etc.), or as a descriptive value (fast, slow, simple, complex, short, long).
- Parameters are not assigned to any voice since the same module can be used in multiple voices.

## Comments:

Comments can be added to the patch by prepending two forward slashes (//). 

Example:

```
// This is a nice comment
```

### Example 1

```
VOICE 1:
	- Metropolis (Pitch) p> Braids (1v/oct) [weight=3]
	- Metropolis (Gate) g> Function (Trigger)
	- Braids (Out) -> Optomix (Ch1 Signal)
	- Function (+ Out) >> Optomix (Ch1 CV)
	- Function (- Out) >> Braids (Timbre CV)
	- Optomix (Out 1) -> AUDIO INTERFACE (input)
	
	* Metropolis:
	| BPM = 124
	| Swing = 0
	| Root = F
	| Scale = Minor
	| Mode = F. Forward
	| Stages = 16
	
	* Braids:
	| Mode = Fold
	| Timbre = 30%
	| Timbre CV = -20%
	| Color = 0%

	* Function: Rise = 50% | Fall = 50% | Curve = 30%
	* Optomix: Damp = 0% | Control = 100%
```

### Example 2

```
VOICE 1:

	- Metropolis (Pitch) p> Aether VCO (CV)
	- Metropolis (Gate) g> Maths (Ch 1 Trigger)
	- Metropolis (Gate) g> Maths (Ch 4 Trigger)
	
	* Aether VCO: LFO Freq = 5 | LFO PWM = 7
	- Aether VCO (Pulse) -> Mixer (Ch1)
	- Aether VCO (Sub 1) -> Tides (Clk)
	- Tides (Bi) -> Mixer (Ch2)
	- Aether VCO (Sub 2) -> Z3000 (HSync)
	- Z3000 (Saw) -> Mixer (Ch3)
	
	- MultiLFO (LFO 1) >> Tides (Smoothness)
	- MultiLFO (LFO 2 Triangle) >> Tides (Shape)
	- MultiLFO (LFO 3 Triangle) >> Z3000 (PWM)
	* MultiLFO:
	| LFO 1 Freq = 3.8
	| LFO 1 Shape = Sine
	| LFO 1 S&H = 0
	| LFO 2 Freq = 1
	| LFO 3 Freq = 1
	* Tides: PLL Mode = True | Freq = 60% | Smoothness = 70%
	* Z3000: Freq = 1pm
	
	- Maths (Ch 1) >> Multifilter (CV)
	- Maths (Ch 4) >> uVCA (Ch1 CV)
	
	- Mixer (Output) -> Multifilter (Input)
	- Multifilter (LPF) -> uVCA (Ch1 Input)
	- uVCA (Ch1 Output) -> AUDIO INTERFACE (In 3)
